Nick Meyer is a senior software engineer at Verizon Media, where he architects 
and builds solutions to help teams deliver infrastructure at Internet scale with
startup agility. When he isn't tearing down roadblocks and automating mundane
tasks, he might be found playing [Hoot Owl Hoot](https://www.mindware.orientaltrading.com/hoot-owl-hoot-cooperative-game-a2-GM106.fltr?categoryId=90000+2890) with his
children, performing with the [Omaha Chamber Singers](https://omahachambersingersonline.org),
or tinkering with his homemade wireless grill thermometer.

He flatly denies that the hash he uses to identify himself to the internet is a
measurement of his personality.
