So here we are again.

After 20 years, you'd think I'd have gotten the hang of keeping a personal
website current and up to date. Alas, times and priorities change.

Hopefully now that it's easy to build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) that will
change and I can stick around for awhile and actually keep this up to date and
post regularly.

We'll see.
