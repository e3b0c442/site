I just wanted to share this note from [hamsterdave](https://reddit.com/u/hamsterdave) on [reddit](https://reddit.com):

> "... I'm a storm chaser with a fair amount of experience with hurricanes, including both of the 2 most recent Carolina landfalls, Arthur and Matthew. This storm will not be like either of those, or like anything the US mainland has seen in a long time. It isn't going to just be a storm surge disaster like Katrina, or a rainer like Harvey, or catastrophic wind damage like Andrew. It has the potential to be all three, and could very well (if it doesn't slow down too much before land fall) be the most powerful hurricane to make landfall on the US mainland since Andrew in 1992. The Carolina coast has had a prolonged quiet period with only a few relatively minor hurricane strikes in the last 20 years. It is imperative that people do not fall victim to complacency with this storm. ..."
