Over the past few years, I have enjoyed working through the problems of the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) series as learning exercises. I have
used them to dip my toe into new languages, but I have generally done them
ad-hoc without a lot of discussion or analysis. I'll be starting a series on
this blog discussing the Advent of Code problems in the context of similar
problems in computer science, analyzing the complexity of the problem and
possible solutions, and discussing implementation details. I hope you find these
posts enlightening.

I will update this post with links to new posts in this series as I make them, 
so feel free to bookmark this post as a shortcut.
