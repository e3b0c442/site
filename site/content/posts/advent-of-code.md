Over the past few years, I have enjoyed working through the problems of the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) series as learning exercises. I have
used them to dip my toe into new languages, but I have generally done them
ad-hoc without a lot of discussion or analysis. I'll be starting a series on
this blog discussing the Advent of Code problems in the context of similar
problems in computer science, analyzing the complexity of the problem and
possible solutions, and discussing implementation details. In each post, I will
cover both of the days problems as seperate, even though in many cases
they are similar.

I will update this post with links to new posts in this series as I make them, 
so feel free to bookmark this post as a shortcut. I hope you find these
posts enlightening, and if you have additional feedback about how to optimize
or better solve these puzzles, please leave comments.

The code for my solutions can be found in [my Advent of Code repository](https://github.com/e3b0c442/advent)
